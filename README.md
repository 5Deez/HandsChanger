HandsChanger is a mod for my summer car using MSCloader to create custom hands textures

How to install custom texture:
To add your own hadns texture through this mod go to your Mods folder then Assets/HandsChanger. In HandsChanger folder you will see all the textures that come with mod by default. Find the 'hand_clear' file and edit it and save as new with different name. If everything was done correctly you will find your new hands file's name in the mod's settings list in game!
